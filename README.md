# Node.js

This repository is going to contain the files I generate during my Node.js studies. As I study I'm updating the repository with the new information and the code.
The name of the files with the code will contain the number of the sections it is related.

## 1 - Introduction 
In this section,  we are going to understand the basic concepts about Node.js and how it works, getting a solid base to keep going with it.

### 1.1 => Execution: 
Node.js apps can be executed through the docs or by terminal. To execute them by terminal we have to type 'node [file_name]', probably this option will be useful for debbuging and testing.

### 1.2 - First code:
Now we are going to understand how to create the first file (in this moment, the first program will be written with only one file)
=> The extension will be .js;
=> We are going to execute it using 'node <file_name>';
=> This code is going to be interpreted and the program is going to be executed.

### 1.3 - Importing module:
Inside Node aplications it is very commom to use modules to do some basic stuff. To start and understand it, we are going to use a module called File System, from Node. This module is used to work with files and folders and it's called a 'core module', what means that it is provided by Node itself, not being necessary to install it from other sources. At last, to import this modulo we are going to use the 'require' method, although theres is also the 'import' method.
